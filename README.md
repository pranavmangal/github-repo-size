A simple browser extension that displays the size of a GitHub repository on its homepage.

It is designed to integrate well with GitHub's responsive interface and also with the [Refined GitHub](https://github.com/refined-github/refined-github) browser extension.

It also supports displaying the sizes for non-public repositories by allowing you to submit a GitHub personal access token with the necessary permissions.
